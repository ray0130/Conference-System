This is a Conference System that is created for CSC207: Software Design during my Sophomore year.

It is separated into 2 phases, where Phase 2 includes more features and a more complex structure than Phase 1.
This System is written in Java and fully utilizes Object Oriented Programming for managing Conferences such as Attendees, Speakers, Admins, and it also supports Announcements, Chat, Requests, and Events features.
We also adopted the Clean Architecture Design Pattern as well as the SOLID design pattern in our design process.
A UML is attached to each phase to outline the object relationships in this program
